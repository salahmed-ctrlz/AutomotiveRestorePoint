Step 1: Create a PowerShell Script  

Open Notepad or any text editor and copy the following PowerShell script:

# Define the name for the restore point

$RestorePointName = "AutoRestorePoint"

# Create the restore point

Checkpoint-Computer -Description $RestorePointName -RestorePointType "MODIFY_SETTINGS"
Save the file with a .ps1 extension, such as CreateRestorePoint.ps1.

Step 2: Access the Startup Folder  

Press Win + R to open the Run dialog, type shell:startup, and hit Enter. This will open the Startup folder where you'll place the PowerShell script.

Step 3: Move the Script to Startup  

Move or copy the PowerShell script file (`CreateRestorePoint.ps1`) into the Startup folder. This ensures that the script runs automatically every time your PC restarts.
